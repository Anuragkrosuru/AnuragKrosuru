I am a driven software engineer focused on developing full-stack applications, leveraging cloud-native solutions, and exploring the potential of machine learning.

My experience ranges from developing enterprise-grade backends at Ford to building AI-powered debugging tools.

I thrive on architecting robust systems, such as a full-stack Instagram clone deployed on AWS and a search engine built from the ground up using a custom MapReduce pipeline.
